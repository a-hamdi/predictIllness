# Illness Detection and Classification
This project aims to classify illnesses based on a set of symptoms. It uses a machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of an illness based on a patient's reported symptoms.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This project requires the following Python packages:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

Installation

Clone the repo.

## Usage
The program prompts the user to input a set of symptoms, and outputs a predicted illness based on the symptoms entered.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains a list of illnesses and their corresponding symptoms.

Algorithm
The machine learning algorithm used for this project is SVC. It was chosen because of its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets.

Results
The algorithm was trained on 4920 samples and achieved an accuracy of 94.03%.

Future Work
In the future, we plan to expand this project by adding more illnesses to the dataset, improving the accuracy of the algorithm, and creating a user interface for easier use.
